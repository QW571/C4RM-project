C4RM Final Project - Covid Cases

Our project aims to study trends in daily new cases of COVID-19 infections, vaccinations, average temperatures, and the relationship between them in New York City. The period is from January 1 to July 31, 2022.
On the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, we found data of daily new cases of COVID-19 and vaccinations in NYC. Daily temperatures for NYC were available on the National Weather Service website. All data was filtered, consolidated into a new Excel file and converted to a csv file.

Here are the reference links for the data:
